# Calypso CSV App

To run this app locally:
1. Install Docker
2. Clone repository
3. Run `docker-compose build` from root of cloned directory
4. Then run `docker-compose up`

This will spin up 2 docker containers: one for the UI and one for the API.

You can access the UI on `http://localhost:4200/`


Note:
This is a pretty rough draft. There are still things I would like to add, such as specific services and "component-ization".
